Reflective Questions
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, the primary challenge was to efficiently manage and manipulate course data for a university's course management system. This involved implementing different data structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree) to store, retrieve, and manipulate course information such as course IDs, titles, and prerequisites.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach was to evaluate and implement various data structures, each tailored to specific needs of the course management system. Data structures are critical because they directly impact the efficiency of operations like searching, inserting, and deleting data. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each data structure allowed me to make informed decisions on which to use based on the requirements of the system.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Roadblocks were primarily encountered when the data structures didn't perform as expected under certain conditions, such as unbalanced Binary Search Trees or Hash Table collisions. I overcame these by researching best practices, like balancing techniques for trees and implementing better hash functions or handling collisions gracefully.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has broadened my understanding of how critical the choice of data structure is to the overall performance and scalability of software. Iâ€™ve learned to analyze the problem more thoroughly before choosing a data structure, ensuring it aligns with both the current needs and potential future demands of the application.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project has reinforced the importance of writing clean, modular code. By using well-defined classes and methods, I ensured that the program was easy to maintain and adapt as new requirements emerged. Additionally, I emphasized clear documentation and consistent coding standards, which are crucial for readability and future maintenance.

Integrated Reflection Paragraph
In the course projects, I tackled the challenge of efficiently managing university course data by implementing various data structures like Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. The choice of data structure was crucial as it directly influenced the efficiency of operations like searching, adding, and removing course information. Throughout the project, I encountered challenges such as handling Hash Table collisions and managing unbalanced Binary Search Trees, which I overcame by applying best practices and making thoughtful adjustments to my approach. This experience has deepened my understanding of the impact of data structures on software performance and scalability. It has also reinforced the importance of designing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, emphasizing modularity, clear documentation, and consistent coding standards to ensure the longevity and ease of future development.
